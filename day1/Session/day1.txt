- Intro and applications of Golang

- Variables
    Variables can be declared as follows
        var var_name datatype
    (or) var_name := value

Go is statically typed language. when := is used the value's data 
type is detected by go and the variable is assigned the datatype

Datatypes
-------------------
Two types:
- Reference (Slice, Maps, etc)
- Value  (Array, String, etc)
Reference datatypes are pointer to value types and are mutable.
Value type are immutable

Package
-------------------
Created and used for name resolutions or isolation of functions and data-structures
Also for readablity and resuablity of code
Types:
    - Exceutable
    - Reference

Constants:
-------------------
Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.
Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.
Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.

e.g. const Pi = 3.14

Array and slices
-------------------
Arrays are fixed list of data of same datatype i.e. var arr [10]int
Slices and mutable lists of same datatype i.e. var arr_s []int
